***** Keras *****
> a higher level API to do NN than pure Tensorflow
> comes with Tensorflow
> Keras takes care of a lot of details but is a bit slower because of this
> it is good for prototyping, the fine tuning can be done with pure tensorflow
> more time spent on tuning and figuring out a good topology for the NN
> it is integrated with SciKit Learn
